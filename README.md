<p align = "center"><b>[⁉]</b>As the title says, the project is based on the idea of converting various units of measurement from different fields.<br>
<b>[🔁]</b>The program is quite simple, we choose a size on the left side, which we will transform into a size on the right side.<br>
<b>[📝]</b>The programme benefits from the following physical sizes:<br></p>
<ul align = "center">
📏 - Distance<br>
🌡️ - Temperature<br>
⚖ - Mass<br>
</ul>
<p align = "center"><b>[🛑]</b>You cannot currently use comma numbers for transformation.<br></p>
<h3 align = "center">[⛔]Known issues:[⛔]</h3>
<p align = "center">[🧹]At the moment we have not discovered any problems, the functionality of the program has been tested for quite some time.</p>
<h3 align = "center">[🚀]Possibilities to improve the program:[🚀]></h3>
<p align = "center"><b>[➕]</b>Adding more sizes.<br>
<b>[🔎]</b>After reaching a larger number of sizes add a search box.</p>
